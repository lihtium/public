      <description>Let’s start this journey with the most basic, yet most important “parameters” of any solvency 2 calculations : the risk-free interest rate. EIOPA, the european insurance and occupational pensions authority uses the Smith-Wilson model to publish the relevant risk free interest rate term structures, also called the RFR.
According to article 77 of the Solvency 2 directive, the best estimate of technical provisions shall correspond to the probability-weighted average of future cash-flows, taking account of the time value of money (expected present value of future cash-flows), using the relevant risk-free interest rate term structure.</description>
