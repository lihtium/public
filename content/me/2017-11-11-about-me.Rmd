## Education and Work experience
I grew up in Luxembourg, a small western european country and studied in Strasbourg (UdS) and eventually graduated in 2012.
Now I live in Luxembourg and work as an actuary for a local insurance company.

In order to work effectively with the finance department, I also attented a course in stochastic finance at UCL in Belgium.
