      <description>Several days ago, I was playing a chinese card game 鋤大D with a bunch of friends and I was wondering what were the different odds of obtaining certain sets of cards. So instead of calculating these probabilities, why not just estimate them ?
The rules of the game Let me explain here briefly how this game works. We start with a shuffled deck of 52 cards and distribute them to 4 players, one by one, eventually everyone will have 13 cards.</description>
