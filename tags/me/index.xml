      <description>Education and Work experience I grew up in Luxembourg, a small western european country and studied in Strasbourg (UdS) and eventually graduated in 2012. Now I live in Luxembourg and work as an actuary for a local insurance company. I had the opportunity to work on several non-life and life insurance topic before going over to asset and liability management.
In order to work effectively with the finance department, I also attented a course in stochastic finance at UCL in Belgium.</description>
